This is a web app I created for me and my friends to keep track of rounds of golf we have played. It will use the data for each round to calculate various statistics such as handicap index and scoring average. It uses the Flask framework for the backend, Jinja2 for rendering templates and Pandas for some of the calculations. I created it to practice Flask; it's a work in progress.
