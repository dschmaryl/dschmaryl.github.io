title: "About me"

My name is Daryl and my passion is writing code and watching it work. I especially love creating things which can make my or someone else's life easier, which I find to be tremendously satisfying. I have been using Linux for a number of years and I really enjoy writing scripts to automate tasks in order to create a smoother environment for whatever I happen to be doing. Another area from which I get a lot of satisfaction is the design of algorithms that solve various problems.

Other interests of mine include music and playing guitar. I love all kinds of music from jazz to rock to electronic. I am also a little obsessed with golf, a game with which I have an intense love/hate relationship.
